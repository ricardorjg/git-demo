sword and spear
wall of shields
standing strong
on this their chosen battle field

Hail Majestic Corporate Light
Heaven Born and Ever bright
How our spirit like the waves
at the breath of thine awakes

And now the night of weeping shall be
The morn of song
Ah! we are those whose thunder
Shakes the skies - the thin spun life
